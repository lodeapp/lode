#### What Are Cookies

As is common practice with almost all professional websites, this site uses cookies (tiny files that are downloaded to your computer), to improve your experience. This page describes what information they gather, how we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored, however this may downgrade or "break" certain elements of the site's functionality.

For more general information on cookies see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a> on HTTP Cookies.

#### How We Use Cookies

We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed. Unfortunately there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or not, in case they are used to provide a service that you might benefit from.

#### Disabling Cookies

You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser's Help section for how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other websites that you visit, therefore it is recommended that you do not disable cookies.

#### The Cookies We Set

The only proprietary cookie this website sets is meant to -- somewhat ironically -- remember whether you've already consented to the use of cookies. We set third-party cookies, though (see below).
