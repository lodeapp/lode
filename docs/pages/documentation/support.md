# Support

If you're still having trouble setting up Lode or making it work properly, [let us know](mailto:info@recontra.co). We'll try to help as much as possible, but please understand it might not be possible to accommodate all setups at this moment in time.

When contacting us for support queries, make sure you include all pertinent log files. You can reveal those from inside Lode by going to the application menu: Help → Troubleshooting → Show Logs in Finder
