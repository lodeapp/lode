    title="Run tests selectively"
    description="Select which files or even individual tests to run, all with just a a click. And quickly focus on just the tests you need by filtering by outcome or keyword &mdash; handy for when you want to re-run only failed ones, or narrow down that test you were just refactoring."
/>

<Feature
    slug="light-feature-2"
    title="See results in real-time"
    description="Syntax-highlighted diffs and traces available as soon as a test fails &mdash; no more waiting for the full run to see what went wrong, or scanning through traces in the CLI. Every test result has its own pane and each trace frame is actionable, so you can copy its contents or open the affected files with just a few clicks."

<Feature
    slug="light-feature-3"
    title="Dynamic sorting"
    description="Sort your test files by name, last run or last updated dates, or even by duration &mdash; before, after or even during a run. Understand which tests are making your suites run slowly so you can prioritize the ones to take action on."
